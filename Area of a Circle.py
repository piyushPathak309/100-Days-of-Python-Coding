# Write a Python program that finds the area of a circle from the value of the diameter d.
#
# The value of d should be provided by the user.
#
# The area of a circle is equal to pi*(radius)^2. The radius is the value of the diameter divided by 2.
#
# Round the value of the area to two decimal places.
#
# You may assume that the value of the diameter will be non-negative integer.
import math as m
R = float(input("Enter a Radius :"))
Area = (m.pi*R**2)
