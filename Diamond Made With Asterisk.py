# Write a Python program that prints a diamond made with asterisks where the diamond's height (number of rows) is determined by the value of the variable height
#
# You can (optionally) ask the user to enter the value of height.
#
# This value can only have an odd number of rows, so you should print a descriptive message if the user enters an even value.
#
# ðŸ”¹ Expected Output:
# If height is equal to 7, this is the expected output:
#
#    *
#   ***
#  *****
# *******
#  *****
#   ***
#    *
