# Write a Python program that prints a triangular pattern like the ones shown below in the examples.
#
# Each row must have its corresponding number of asterisks. The first row contains one asterisk. The second row contains two asterisks. The third row contains three asterisks and so on.
#
# The number of rows should be determined by the value of n, a value entered by the user.
#
# ðŸ”¹ Expected Output:
# If the value of n is 3:
#
# *
# * *
# * * *
# If the value of n is 5:
#
# *
# * *
# * * *
