# Write a Python program that prints a triangular pattern made with letters (as shown below).
#
# The first row should have one letter A (in uppercase). The second row should have two letters B. The third row should have three letters C and so on.
#
# The number of rows is determined by the value of n, which is entered by the user.
#
# The letters must be separated by a space.
#
# ðŸ”¹ Expected Output:
# If the value of n is 3, this is the expected output:
#
# A
# B B
# C C C
# If the value of n is 5, this is the expected output:
#
# A
# B B
# C C C
# D D D D
# E E E E E
