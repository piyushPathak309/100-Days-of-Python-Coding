# Write a Python program that simulates the "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game.
#
# The game should ask the user to enter an option (either "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors").
#
# The player should play against the computer, which will select a random option.
#
# The computer's selection will be compared against the player's selection to determine who wins.
#
# A descriptive message should be displayed indicating if the player won, lost, or if the game ended in a tie.
#
# To learn more about this game before starting to solve this challenge, I recommend reading this resource.
#
# Basic Game Rules:
#
# Paper beats Rock
#
# Rock beats Scissors
#
# Scissors beat Paper.
#
# ðŸ”¹ Expected Output:
# Sample Game 1:
#
# ====== Welcome to the game ======
# Please enter Rock, Paper, or Scissors below:
# Rock
# It's a tie! Try again.
